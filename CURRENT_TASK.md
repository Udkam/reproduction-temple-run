# Current Task

## Active slice: TR2 — Humanized runner refinement

Branch: `codex/temple-run`

Status: candidate verified; independent QA and coordinator acceptance are pending. The slice is not yet accepted.

### Required outcome

Refine the existing complete third-person runner without changing its clean-room boundary:

- deterministic procedural course generation and replayable simulation state
- continuous acceleration and three-lane movement
- jump, slide, correct/incorrect 90-degree turns, gaps, blockers, pickups, and shield
- fair generation with reaction-distance validation
- distance, score, shards, multiplier, best score, pause, restart, and game over
- fixed-step runtime and smooth interpolated Three.js presentation
- runner animation, chase pressure, camera follow, turn camera, impacts, and procedural audio
- keyboard, real one-finger swipe, and visible accessible controls
- responsive desktop, portrait, and landscape layouts
- reduced motion, high contrast, audio toggle, and lifecycle cleanup
- unit tests, deterministic replay tests, build, browser interaction, screenshots, and performance evidence
- canonical visible pursuit pressure, 250 m milestone events, score-first HUD hierarchy, articulated gait, organic ruin palette, and distinct obstacle silhouettes
- recoverable non-gap stumbles that deterministically close pursuit distance, with repeated misses leading to a reachable pursuer capture
- milestone, close-chase, beam, ring, column, and gap QA states reproduced exclusively from public command traces
- browser assertions for exact HUD values, pursuer clipped bounds/area, and per-kind obstacle clipped bounds

### Non-goals

- copied Temple Run branding, characters, monsters, art, music, UI, screenshots, or source
- shops, ads, accounts, purchases, online leaderboards, unlock trees, or multiple environments
- importing implementation from `codex/tetris`
- shipping another game mode before TR1 acceptance

### Completion gate

TR2 is complete only after typecheck, one final full test suite, production build, desktop keyboard play, mobile touch/swipe play, pause/blur/visibility checks, deterministic chase/milestone/turn/jump/slide/collision scenarios, screenshot review, console inspection, resource cleanup, and performance evidence pass.

### Completion evidence

- Final typecheck passed: `npm.cmd run typecheck`.
- Final Vitest suite passed: 11 files, 47 tests.
- Production build passed: `npm.cmd run build`. Vite emitted only its non-blocking 500 kB chunk advisory.
- Official Chrome 150.0.7871.115 evidence pass recorded 23 records in `docs/qa/temple-browser-evidence.json`, with 19 final screenshots, zero console/page errors, zero WebGL context losses, one canvas, zero gameplay DOM entities, and no horizontal overflow.
- The command-derived milestone state replayed to `78bd1dc3` at 250.0899 m with score 5,101, floored HUD distance 250, flow 2, one shard, and the visible `250 m` callout. The command-derived close chase replayed to `fa85830e` with `chaseGap` 1.194 m and pursuer clipped area 64,374.2 CSS px².
- Command-derived beam/ring/column/gap previews replayed to their recorded hashes with positive clipped areas of 18,510.5 / 25,497.2 / 2,952.2 / 29,607.6 CSS px². Each record retains its full accepted public-command trace and matching replay hash.
- Scene preparation benchmarks: desktop p95 0.10 ms (limit 8 ms), mobile p95 0.10 ms (limit 12 ms). Real keyboard left/jump/pause and real DPR3 touch swipe each produced one semantic action trace.
- Visual review completed against `milestone.png`, `chase-close.png`, `gap-preview.png`, and `ring-preview.png` under `docs/screenshots/temple/final/`. They show the canonical HUD, visible close pursuers, readable gap lips/far edge, and mobile ring silhouette.
