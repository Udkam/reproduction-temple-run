# Current Project Status

Status: Stage 3A recursive space interaction prototype implemented and
verified after the Stage 2 renderer foundation.

The current workspace is runnable as a React/Vite/PixiJS v8 visual-spatial
prototype. It intentionally contains no gameplay logic, movement system, levels,
board grid, undo/redo, or ECS implementation.

## Current Workspace

- Current branch: `main`
- Implementation files in the working tree: Stage 3A visual interaction
  prototype only
- Required records in the working tree: present
- Draft approval documents in the working tree:
  - `ARCHITECTURE.md`
  - `DESIGN_REFERENCE.md`
  - `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
- Approval status: approved through Stage 3A recursive space interaction
  prototype only
- Local cleanup state: reset cleanup and Stage 2 renderer foundation are staged
  for the required main-branch publication step

## Preserved Records

- `docs/logs/CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/reboot/FAILED_ROUND.md`
- `docs/reboot/CURRENT_STATUS.md`

## Do Not Continue

Do not continue future work from:

- `feature/recursive-box-lab`
- `reboot/parabox-worldline-v8-reboot-parabox-worldline-20260624-023038-2a151f`

Those branches represent failed implementation rounds. The next attempt should
start from a fresh plan and should not copy implementation files from either
failed round.

## Current Gate

Do not create gameplay logic, levels, board grids, movement systems, undo/redo,
ECS implementation, or Stage 3B work.
