# Current Project Status

Status: Phase A recursive-foundation rebuild is active after the design reboot.
D0, the complete I1 interface bridge, and C1 deterministic core are
independently accepted and integrated. V1 production remains closed while its
exact occurrence-address/visual-transaction authorization text receives
frontend-owner and independent-QA review. The user assesses the overall target
as less than 10% complete.

`Stage 6` is a historical implementation label only. It does not mean that the
visual design, recursive rules, gameplay depth, runtime stability, content, or
playability has reached Stage 6-level completeness or release readiness.

The current workspace is runnable as a React/Vite/PixiJS v8 visual-spatial
prototype backed by a deterministic TypeScript recursive gameplay kernel, an
event-driven animation pipeline, and metric-driven PixiJS renderer alignment.
It intentionally contains no React gameplay UI, level packs, level editor,
menus, polish UI, large content, or new gameplay rules.

## Current Workspace

- Current branch: `main`
- Implementation files in the working tree: Stage 6 renderer fidelity alignment
  plus prior renderer/prototype/kernel stages
- Required records in the working tree: present
- Draft approval documents in the working tree:
  - `ARCHITECTURE.md`
  - `DESIGN_REFERENCE.md`
  - `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
- Approval status: R1 and D0 contracts, the complete I1 public-interface chain,
  and C1 deterministic core are independently accepted and integrated. V1 is
  not yet authorized for source edits; its exact documentation gate is under
  review. Historical Stage numbers are not current authority.
- Local cleanup state: no generated build output retained; dev server stopped

## Preserved Records

- `docs/logs/CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/reboot/FAILED_ROUND.md`
- `docs/reboot/CURRENT_STATUS.md`

## Do Not Continue

Do not continue future work from:

- `feature/recursive-box-lab`
- `reboot/parabox-worldline-v8-reboot-parabox-worldline-20260624-023038-2a151f`

Those branches represent failed implementation rounds. The next attempt should
start from a fresh plan and should not copy implementation files from either
failed round.

## Current Gate

The user explicitly requested continued frontend and game-engine development on
2026-07-11, with repository contracts written first. `AGENTS.md`, `DESIGN.md`,
and `CURRENT_TASK.md` now define the active authority, design target, exact
slice order, ownership, and QA gates.

The dependency order is D0 documentation, accepted I1 shared public-interface
bridge, C1 deterministic core safety, V1 occurrence-address projection and
unified visual completion ownership, then V2 composition/material, V3 retained
rendering/performance, and V4 responsive input/accessibility/capture. Every
implementation slice requires independent QA before the next starts.

Per the user's 2026-07-12 clarification, no level design, serialization,
authored test level, solver, or campaign content begins until the complete C1
and V1-V4 frontend-and-engine framework is accepted and integrated. After that
gate, the first content slice is one original showcase acceptance level; test
level expansion starts only after the user accepts that showcase.

Do not treat this authorization as permission for overlapping workstreams,
large content, copied assets, unreviewed schema, or a one-shot rewrite. No
production slice is active while the V1 authorization-document candidate is
under review.
