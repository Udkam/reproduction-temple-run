# Codex Work Log

## 2026-07-07 - Stage 2 PixiJS Renderer Foundation

Phase: approved Stage 2 renderer foundation.

Time:
- 2026-07-07 03:58:00 +08:00

Actions taken:
- Re-read current PixiJS v8.16 documentation through Context7 before coding.
- Re-inspected Stage 1 runtime, React host, design reference, architecture
  contract, git branch state, and remotes.
- Compared the Stage 1 canvas screenshot against official void/slab reference
  screenshot 2 using local image viewing tools.
- Added a projection layer that builds a bounded view of a visual-only canonical
  graph: World A contains recursive container B, whose `innerWorldId` projects
  World C.
- Added Pixi renderer foundation files for app lifecycle, deterministic camera
  fit/zoom API, display layers, palette tokens, world slabs, procedural entity
  primitives, and recursive preview masking.
- Replaced Stage 1 direct drawing in `GameRuntime` with runtime wiring to
  `PixiApp` and `createStage2Projection()`.
- Restored a minimal `.gitignore` so the required `git add .` does not stage
  dependencies, build output, or browser temporary files.
- Captured `docs/screenshots/stage2-renderer.png` from a browser.
- Did not add gameplay rules, levels, movement, input commands, board grids, or
  ECS implementation.

Verification commands and results:
- `npm.cmd run typecheck`: passed.
- `npm.cmd run build`: passed.
- `npm.cmd run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5173`: served local QA page.
- Browser screenshot: `docs/screenshots/stage2-renderer.png`.
- Browser accessibility snapshot: only `main` and PixiJS canvas were visible;
  no React gameplay nodes.
- Browser console: no warnings or errors; only the standard React DevTools info
  line appeared.
- Pixel sampling: screenshot measured `998x938`, `SampledUniqueColors: 39`,
  `NonBlank: true`, `DarkSampleRatio: 0.405`,
  `SaturatedSampleRatio: 0.285`.
- Source scope search for `Move`, `movement`, `level`, `ECS`, `keyboard`,
  `undo`, `redo`, `grid`, and `cell` found no gameplay implementation.

Changed files:
- `.gitignore`
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `DESIGN_REFERENCE.md`
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
- `docs/logs/CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/reboot/CURRENT_STATUS.md`
- `docs/screenshots/stage2-renderer.png`
- `src/runtime/GameRuntime.ts`
- `src/projection/types.ts`
- `src/projection/worldProjection.ts`
- `src/render/PixiApp.ts`
- `src/render/Camera2D.ts`
- `src/render/layers.ts`
- `src/render/palette.ts`
- `src/render/primitives/worldFrame.ts`
- `src/render/primitives/entityPrimitives.ts`

Risks and limitations:
- The recursive projection is still a static visual prototype, not a playable
  state model.
- The nested preview is readable at desktop QA size but still less detailed
  than official screenshots at tiny scales.
- Camera transition API exists, but no Stage 3 movement/enter/exit interaction
  uses it yet.
- Branch cleanup and push to `origin main` are required as the publication
  closeout for this stage.

Next stage:
- Complete main-branch publication, delete obsolete feature branches, then stop
  for Stage 2 visual gate review.

## 2026-07-07 - Stage 1 PixiJS Runtime Scaffold

Phase: approved Stage 1 scaffold only.

Time:
- 2026-07-07 03:34:00 +08:00

Commit:
- `a82fb6c stage 1: scaffold pixi canvas host`

Actions taken:
- Re-read current PixiJS v8, React, and Vite documentation through Context7 before coding.
- Confirmed the reset baseline and current branch before modification.
- Created a React/TypeScript/Vite/PixiJS v8 scaffold with React limited to host lifecycle ownership.
- Added `GameRuntime` as the owner of PixiJS async initialization, canvas attachment, ticker setup, and cleanup.
- Added a static PixiJS diagnostic marker scene only to make the canvas visibly nonblank.
- Added an inline favicon data URL to avoid a browser default `/favicon.ico` 404 during clean verification.
- Did not add gameplay logic, levels, movement, or ECS implementation.
- Fixed a StrictMode development cleanup issue by assigning the PixiJS `Application` only after `await app.init(...)` completes.
- Installed dependencies, ran checks, launched Vite, inspected the page in Chrome, and captured screenshot evidence.

Verification commands and results:
- `npm.cmd install`: passed, added 35 packages and updated `package-lock.json`.
- `npm.cmd run typecheck`: passed.
- `npm.cmd run build`: passed; Vite built successfully.
- `npm.cmd run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5173`: started Vite at `http://127.0.0.1:5173/`.
- Chrome inspection: page contained one visible `canvas[data-testid="pixi-canvas"]` under `div[data-testid="pixi-stage-host"]`.
- Chrome inspection: no DOM gameplay selectors were present (`gameplayNodeCount: 0`).
- Browser console inspection: no errors or warnings on the final clean verification page; only the standard React DevTools info line was present.
- Screenshot capture: wrote `docs/screenshots/stage1-canvas.png`.
- Pixel sampling: screenshot measured `996x991`, `SampledUniqueColors: 8`, `NonBlank: true`.

Changed files:
- `package.json`
- `package-lock.json`
- `vite.config.ts`
- `tsconfig.json`
- `index.html`
- `src/main.tsx`
- `src/app/GameCanvasHost.tsx`
- `src/runtime/GameRuntime.ts`
- `src/styles/app.css`
- `docs/screenshots/stage1-canvas.png`
- `docs/logs/CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/reboot/CURRENT_STATUS.md`

Risks and limitations:
- This stage intentionally contains no gameplay state, no rules, no levels, and no ECS.
- The canvas marker scene is verification-only scaffolding and is not a level or gameplay entity model.
- In-app browser was unavailable in this session, so Chrome extension control was used for browser verification.

Next stage:
- Stop here until Stage 2 is explicitly approved.

## 2026-07-07 - Patrick's Parabox Architecture Research Draft

Phase: pre-implementation research and architecture documentation.

Time:
- 2026-07-07 03:18:00 +08:00

Actions taken:
- Reconfirmed the worktree is records-only after the failed implementation reset.
- Inspected git history, old architecture/spec/plan/design audit documents, and old core engine types as evidence only.
- Reviewed official Patrick's Parabox website, press kit screenshots, Steam page, SteamDB metadata, and GameDeveloper interview.
- Searched GitHub for Patrick's Parabox demakes, ports, PuzzleScript versions, and related recursive puzzle references.
- Used Context7 for current PixiJS, React, and Vite documentation relevant to a PixiJS/WebGL implementation.
- Confirmed the repo-local `craft-frontend-design` skill file is unavailable after reset; used local memory guidance only as process context.
- Created draft approval-gated documentation:
  - `ARCHITECTURE.md`
  - `DESIGN_REFERENCE.md`
  - `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
- Used Chrome browser control to inspect the official press page and confirm the
  screenshot image list and natural dimensions.
- Downloaded the eight official full-size screenshots to a system temporary
  directory for analysis only; no reference images were added to the repository.
- Generated a temporary contact sheet and inspected it with the image viewer.
- Ran a Pillow-based metric pass over the temporary screenshots to extract
  dark/void coverage, saturation coverage, dominant color families, and
  composition modes.
- Removed the temporary screenshot analysis directory after updating the
  documents.
- Updated the draft documents with measured visual-reference targets.
- Reopened GitHub reference pages for related engines and demakes, then added a
  related-engine audit to `DESIGN_REFERENCE.md`.
- Added a requirement traceability table to `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` mapping the
  active objective to current evidence and pre-implementation status.
- Added non-negotiable architecture invariants and rejected approaches to
  `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- Added a risk register, per-stage failure conditions, and first-commit hard
  stop checks to `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.
- Added visual regression red flags to `DESIGN_REFERENCE.md`.
- Added a module dependency contract to `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- Added a pre-implementation readiness audit and implementation directory
  contract to `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.
- Added an approval decision record and default post-approval decisions to
  `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.
- Updated `docs/reboot/CURRENT_STATUS.md` to show that approval documents exist
  but are not yet approved for implementation.
- Performed a blocked audit: the pre-code evidence and approval documents are
  present, but implementation remains forbidden because no architecture approval
  has been recorded.

Verification commands and results:
- `Get-ChildItem -Force`: confirmed only `.git` and `docs` existed before draft docs were added.
- `git status --short --branch`: confirmed current branch is `feature/recursive-box-lab` and cleanup remains uncommitted.
- `git log --oneline --decorate --graph --all -n 30`: reviewed failed and prior implementation history.
- `git show HEAD:docs/recursive-box-lab/*`: reviewed old documents without restoring them.
- External browsing: reviewed official screenshots and GitHub references listed in `DESIGN_REFERENCE.md`.
- Context7 docs lookup: resolved PixiJS `/pixijs/pixijs`, React `/reactjs/react.dev`, and Vite `/vitejs/vite`.
- Post-write `Get-ChildItem -Force`: confirmed root contains `.git`, `docs`, and the three new draft documentation files.
- Post-write `rg -n "Status:|Do not implement|Implementation must not start|PixiJS|Approval" ARCHITECTURE.md DESIGN_REFERENCE.md IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`: confirmed the approval gate and PixiJS/WebGL direction are explicitly documented.
- Post-write `git status --short --branch`: confirmed documentation files are untracked/modified only; no implementation files were created.
- Chrome press-page inspection: confirmed eight screenshots with natural size
  `1920x1080`.
- `Invoke-WebRequest` to `%TEMP%\parabox-official-reference`: downloaded eight
  PNG screenshots for temporary analysis.
- `py -c ...`: created a temporary contact sheet and extracted quantitative
  color/composition metrics with Pillow.
- `Remove-Item` after resolving the path under `%TEMP%`: removed the temporary
  screenshot analysis directory.
- Web/GitHub review: checked `kevinychen/patricks-hyperbox`,
  `4454aa/patrick-demake`, `4454aa/Patrick-s-Parabox-Demake---JS-Port`, and the
  PuzzleScript archive reference.
- `rg -n "^#|^##|Approval|Status:|Do not|PixiJS|React|world|camera|input|history|serialization|screenshot|GitHub|Context7|MCP|skill" ARCHITECTURE.md DESIGN_REFERENCE.md IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`: confirmed current docs already contained the core architecture topics before traceability additions.
- `rg -n "^## |Invariants|Rejected|Risk|Approval|First Post|Stage 1|Stage 7|Testing|Non-Commercial|Requirement Traceability" ARCHITECTURE.md DESIGN_REFERENCE.md IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`: identified the remaining approval-readiness gaps before adding invariants, risks, and hard stops.
- `rg -n "Architecture Invariants|Runtime Layers|Testing And Verification|Approval Gate|Risk Register|Requirement Traceability|Stage 1|First Post|Hard stop|Gate 0" ARCHITECTURE.md IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md DESIGN_REFERENCE.md`: confirmed the existing gate and planning structure before adding dependency and directory contracts.
- `rg -n "Approval|Gate|Pre-Implementation|First Post|Hard stop|Current Workspace|Status:" ARCHITECTURE.md IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md DESIGN_REFERENCE.md docs/reboot/CURRENT_STATUS.md docs/logs/CHANGELOG.md`: confirmed approval state references before adding the explicit decision record.
- `rg -n "Requirement Traceability|Pre-Implementation Readiness Audit|Approval Decision Record|Status: not approved|Approval evidence: none recorded|Forbidden next action|Architecture Invariants|Module Dependency Contract|Visual Regression Red Flags|Related engine audit|Browser And Image Inspection Notes|Applicable Skills And MCP Resources" ARCHITECTURE.md DESIGN_REFERENCE.md IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md docs/reboot/CURRENT_STATUS.md`: confirmed the current blocker is approval, not missing pre-code evidence.
- `Test-Path .\src`, `Test-Path .\package.json`, `Test-Path .\vite.config.ts`, `Test-Path .\index.html`: all returned false.

Changed files:
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `DESIGN_REFERENCE.md`
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
- `docs/logs/CHANGELOG.md`

Risks and limitations:
- No implementation code has been written; the architecture is awaiting approval.
- The visual reference is based on browser-accessible screenshots and written analysis, not yet on side-by-side local canvas output.
- Public demake repositories are reference material for rule comparison only and should not be copied into this project.

Next stage:
- Wait for architecture/design/plan approval or revision feedback before creating any React, Vite, TypeScript, PixiJS, or test files.

## 2026-07-07 - Failed Recursive Box Lab Reset

Phase: failed implementation cleanup and restart baseline.

Time:
- 2026-07-07 02:43:03 +08:00

Actions taken:
- Treated the current `feature/recursive-box-lab` implementation as failed by user instruction.
- Deleted all non-record project artifacts from the working tree.
- Preserved only:
  - `.git`
  - `docs/logs/CHANGELOG.md`
  - `docs/reboot/FAILED_ROUND.md`
  - `docs/reboot/CURRENT_STATUS.md`
- Removed source, build output, dependencies, workflow files, local design skill files, generated screenshots, implementation docs, package metadata, and README.
- Updated `docs/reboot/CURRENT_STATUS.md` to describe the current records-only restart baseline.

Verification commands and results:
- `Get-ChildItem -Force`: only `.git` and `docs` remain at repository root.
- `Get-ChildItem -Force -Recurse .\docs`: only `docs/logs/CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/reboot/FAILED_ROUND.md`, and `docs/reboot/CURRENT_STATUS.md` remain.
- `git status --short --branch`: current branch is `feature/recursive-box-lab`; deleted implementation files are working-tree deletions, not staged and not committed.

Changed files:
- `docs/logs/CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/reboot/CURRENT_STATUS.md`
- All non-record implementation files deleted from the working tree.

Risks and limitations:
- The repository is intentionally not runnable after this reset.
- Cleanup is local working-tree state until a commit and push are explicitly performed.
- A future implementation should start with a fresh design/build plan instead of restoring files from the failed recursive-box-lab round.

Next stage:
- Start a fresh implementation branch or baseline only after the new target experience is defined.

## 2026-06-30 - Stage 6E Screenshot-Based Visual Acceptance

Phase: stage 6e visual acceptance artifacts and final verification.

Time:
- 2026-06-30 18:45:00 +08:00

Actions taken:
- Added Playwright as a dev dependency for deterministic local visual capture.
- Added `npm run screenshot` through `scripts/capture-stage6-screenshots.mjs`.
- Generated and committed five Stage 6 acceptance screenshots.
- Hardened the screenshot script for this Windows project path:
  - Replaced direct `npm.cmd` child spawning after it failed with `spawn EINVAL`.
  - Avoided the Windows shell wrapper by launching Vite's Node CLI directly.
  - Confirmed the script exits cleanly and does not leave port `5173` listening.
- Inspected the generated home, level map, level 01, recursive-entry, and help screenshots before committing.

Screenshot artifacts:
- `docs/screenshots/stage6-home.png`
- `docs/screenshots/stage6-level-select.png`
- `docs/screenshots/stage6-level-01.png`
- `docs/screenshots/stage6-recursive-entry.png`
- `docs/screenshots/stage6-help.png`

Verification commands and results:
- `npm.cmd run screenshot`: first attempt failed before starting Vite with `spawn EINVAL`; script was patched.
- `npm.cmd run screenshot`: second attempt produced screenshots but required manual cleanup because the shell wrapper left the Vite child alive; script was patched again.
- `npm.cmd run screenshot`: passed after direct Vite CLI launch and exited cleanly.
- `npm.cmd run test`: passed, 4 test files and 17 tests.
- `npm.cmd run typecheck`: passed.
- `npm.cmd run build`: passed.
- `Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 5173 -State Listen -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue`: no listener after screenshot run.
- `git ls-files docs/logs/CHANGELOG.md`: confirmed the changelog is tracked.

Changed files:
- `package.json`
- `package-lock.json`
- `scripts/capture-stage6-screenshots.mjs`
- `docs/screenshots/stage6-home.png`
- `docs/screenshots/stage6-level-select.png`
- `docs/screenshots/stage6-level-01.png`
- `docs/screenshots/stage6-recursive-entry.png`
- `docs/screenshots/stage6-help.png`
- `docs/logs/CHANGELOG.md`

Risks and limitations:
- Screenshots are static acceptance evidence; they do not replace human playtesting for motion feel.
- Playwright captures Chromium only; other browsers should still be checked before a public release.

Next stage:
- Commit and push Stage 6E acceptance artifacts, then provide the Stage 6F final report.

## 2026-06-30 - Stage 6D Level Curation and Validation

Phase: stage 6d curate the level set around mechanics and add validation.

Time:
- 2026-06-30 18:36:11 +08:00

Actions taken:
- Replaced the previous 15-level quantity-oriented set with 10 curated tutorial experiments.
- Added required metadata to every level:
  - `subtitle`
  - `mechanicTags`
  - `designIntent`
  - `parMoves`
  - `targetMoves`
  - `scriptedSolution`
- Added `src/levels/levelValidation.ts` for level-specific validation.
- Updated `src/levels/tutorial.test.ts` to validate metadata, mechanic tags, and winning scripted solutions.
- Updated `docs/recursive-box-lab/LEVEL_DESIGN.md` to document the curated 10-level arc.
- Updated README from 15 levels to 10 curated levels and changed Help wording from page/view to overlay.

Deleted/replaced filler:
- Removed Stage 5 levels 11-15:
  - North Exit
  - South Exit
  - Inside-to-Outside
  - Vertical Loader
  - Deep Egress
- Reason: they primarily broadened directional coverage or repeated known mechanics instead of improving the first playable teaching arc.

Curated level arc:
1. L1 basic push
2. L2 enter box
3. L3 push out from box
4. L4 push box into box
5. L5 move a world-bearing structure from inside to parent
6. L6 two-layer recursion
7. L7 cross-world targets
8. L8 enter then push out
9. L9 nested box order
10. L10 composite fold

Verification commands and results:
- `npm.cmd run test`: passed, 4 test files and 17 tests.
- `npm.cmd run typecheck`: passed.
- `npm.cmd run build`: passed.

Changed files:
- `src/levels/tutorial.ts`
- `src/levels/levelValidation.ts`
- `src/levels/tutorial.test.ts`
- `docs/recursive-box-lab/LEVEL_DESIGN.md`
- `README.md`
- `docs/logs/CHANGELOG.md`

Next stage:
- Stage 6E: add Playwright screenshot script, generate and commit screenshot acceptance artifacts, and run final verification.

## 2026-06-30 - Stage 6C Visual Gameplay Shell Rewrite

Phase: stage 6c game-first visual and interaction rewrite.

Time:
- 2026-06-30 18:30:35 +08:00

Actions taken:
- Replaced the dashboard-like page chrome with a compact game HUD, central stage, spatial stack, and right-side instrument panel.
- Added `src/styles/tokens.css` for color, radius, shadow, motion, z-index, and typography tokens.
- Rebuilt board styling into a darker glass/experiment board with thicker physical cells, shadows, wall blocks, entry/exit markers, and powered dock targets.
- Replaced lettered player/crate visuals with CSS sprite structures:
  - player probe with lens and directional nose
  - normal crate
  - enterable container with glowing window
  - container/locked variants
- Enlarged recursive container previews and made them feel like windows into nested worlds.
- Reworked Help into an overlay with sprite-based legend.
- Removed the old separate Help page route.
- Reworked About into concise project facts with non-affiliation wording.
- Moved level map and about access into the instrument panel instead of top-level admin tabs.
- Added movement/fold/dock pulse animation hooks with reduced-motion support.

Verification commands and results:
- `npm.cmd run typecheck`: passed.
- `npm.cmd run test`: passed, 4 test files and 16 tests.
- `npm.cmd run build`: passed.

Changed files:
- `src/main.tsx`
- `src/App.tsx`
- `src/styles/tokens.css`
- `src/styles.css`
- `src/ui/GameShell.tsx`
- `src/ui/controls/ControlPanel.tsx`
- `src/ui/world/Cell.tsx`
- `src/ui/world/RecursiveWorldView.tsx`
- `src/ui/world/EntitySprite.tsx`
- `src/ui/help/HelpOverlay.tsx`
- `src/ui/pages/AboutPage.tsx`
- `src/ui/pages/LevelLibrary.tsx`
- Deleted `src/ui/pages/HelpPage.tsx`
- `src/levels/tutorial.ts` interface metadata fields added for Stage 6D

Remaining for Stage 6D:
- Reduce and curate levels around the first 10 mechanics.
- Add required level metadata, validator, and scripted solution coverage.

## 2026-06-30 - Stage 6B Frontend Design Audit

Phase: stage 6b local skill install and human-readable game UI audit.

Time:
- 2026-06-30 18:21:48 +08:00

Actions taken:
- Confirmed `.agents/skills/craft-frontend-design` was missing.
- Copied `craft-frontend-design` from `https://github.com/Udkam/codex-design-skill` commit `a798952effd67ebea39b9732c848e5de89d8263f` into `.agents/skills/craft-frontend-design`.
- Read the source repository `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, local `SKILL.md`, and relevant references: interface taxonomy, visual systems, motion and interaction, platform adapters, and quality gates.
- Ran the skill audit script.
- Wrote `docs/recursive-box-lab/STAGE6_VISUAL_AUDIT.md` with a concrete human critique.

Audit findings summary:
- The current UI is playable but visually fails as game UI.
- The board reads as a pale table/grid, not a physical puzzle object.
- Lettered entities and small previews fail the recursive spatial promise.
- Controls and level selection read as admin UI.
- The rewrite must change shell, board material, sprites, recursion presentation, motion, level curation, and screenshot acceptance.

Verification commands and results:
- `py -m py_compile .agents\skills\craft-frontend-design\scripts\audit_frontend_design.py`: passed.
- `py .agents\skills\craft-frontend-design\scripts\audit_frontend_design.py .`: failed because copied skill reference docs intentionally contain placeholder and generic-copy examples used as anti-pattern documentation.
- `py .agents\skills\craft-frontend-design\scripts\audit_frontend_design.py src`: passed with 0 errors and 0 warnings; info-only note that no visual assets were detected.

Changed files:
- Added `.agents/skills/craft-frontend-design/`.
- Added `docs/recursive-box-lab/STAGE6_VISUAL_AUDIT.md`.
- Updated tracked `docs/logs/CHANGELOG.md`.

Next stage:
- Stage 6C: rewrite app shell, board, sprites, recursion previews, motion, level select, Help, and About so the experience visibly reads as an original recursive puzzle game.

## 2026-06-30 - Stage 6 Visual Gameplay Rewrite Started

Phase: stage 6a changelog tracking fix and visual rejection record.

Time:
- 2026-06-30 18:18:50 +08:00

Current user feedback:
- The current pushed implementation is not accepted visually.
- The page reads like an admin panel or table demo rather than a portfolio-worthy recursive puzzle game.
- Do not continue adding level count as the primary improvement.

Existing problems called out:
1. The board is too empty, pale, and flat, with no spatial hierarchy.
2. The box-inside-box idea is reduced to a tiny unreadable thumbnail.
3. Player and crates are generic lettered shapes without original game identity.
4. Control panel, Debug, and buttons look like default form components.
5. Level selection lacks curated "one new mechanism per level" presentation.
6. The README/design-skill claim is not matched by visible UI quality.
7. `docs/logs/CHANGELOG.md` was ignored and untracked, conflicting with the user's stage-log requirement.

Stage 6 rewrite goals:
- Track and commit this changelog.
- Run a human-readable frontend design audit using the craft frontend design skill.
- Rebuild the app shell, board, recursion presentation, sprites, motion, level selection, help, and about surfaces so the first impression is clearly a game.
- Re-curate levels around mechanics rather than quantity.
- Add screenshot-based visual acceptance artifacts and commit them.

Stage 6A actions:
- Inspected `.gitignore` and confirmed it ignored `docs/logs/CHANGELOG.md`.
- Added explicit unignore rules for `docs/`, `docs/logs/`, and `docs/logs/CHANGELOG.md`.
- Appended this Stage 6 entry so rejection context is preserved in the repository history.

Verification commands and results:
- `git status --short --branch`: clean before Stage 6 edits on `feature/recursive-box-lab`.
- `git check-ignore -v docs/logs/CHANGELOG.md`: confirmed `.gitignore:1` was ignoring the changelog before the fix.
- `git check-ignore -v docs/logs/CHANGELOG.md`: after adding exceptions, the last matching rule is `!docs/logs/CHANGELOG.md`.
- `git status --short --branch`: shows `docs/logs/` as untracked, confirming the changelog can be added to Git.

## 2026-06-30 - Stage 5 Content, Persistence, Docs, and Release Checks

Phase: stage 5 content expansion, quality hardening, and static release readiness.

Time:
- 2026-06-30 10:10:52 +08:00

Actions taken:
- Expanded tutorial content from 10 to 15 original levels.
- Added localStorage progress persistence:
  - current level id
  - completed levels
  - best move counts
- Added dedicated app views:
  - Play
  - Levels
  - Help
  - About
- Added level library with completion and best-move state.
- Added help/about pages inside the app.
- Added `docs/recursive-box-lab/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- Added `docs/recursive-box-lab/LEVEL_DESIGN.md`.
- Updated README with 15-level coverage, persistence, CI, and static deployment notes.
- Added GitHub Actions CI for install, test, typecheck, and build.

Level count:
- 15 original tutorial levels.

Documentation added or updated:
- `README.md`
- `docs/recursive-box-lab/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/recursive-box-lab/LEVEL_DESIGN.md`
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

Verification commands and results:
- `npm.cmd run test`: passed, 4 test files and 16 tests.
- `npm.cmd run typecheck`: passed.
- `npm.cmd run build`: passed; Vite built `dist/` successfully.
- `npm.cmd run dev -- --port 5173`: started local server for clean local-run check.
- No-cache `Invoke-WebRequest` to `http://127.0.0.1:5173/`: returned HTTP 200.
- Stopped the Vite node process and confirmed port 5173 was clear.
- `git grep -n -I -e 'OneDrive' -e 'C:\\Users' -e 'E:\\' -e 'sk-' -- . ':!package-lock.json'`: no tracked-file matches.
- Design audit script: 0 errors and 0 warnings; info-only note that no visual assets were detected, which remains intentional because the game board and entities are rendered as inspectable UI.

Build result:
- Successful production build under `dist/`.
- `dist/` remains ignored and uncommitted.

Known limitations:
- The demo has 15 levels, not 20.
- Infinite recursion remains out of scope.
- GitHub Pages deployment instructions are documented, but no Pages deployment workflow was added beyond CI.

Follow-up TODO:
- Add a level editor or authoring helper if future content grows beyond static tutorial data.
- Consider a deploy-specific Pages workflow if the repository's Pages settings are confirmed.

## 2026-06-30 - Stage 4 Design-Skill UI Polish

Phase: stage 4 UI polish using codex-design-skill principles.

Time:
- 2026-06-30 10:03:32 +08:00

Design-skill source:
- Repository: `https://github.com/Udkam/codex-design-skill`
- Reviewed commit: `a798952effd67ebea39b9732c848e5de89d8263f`
- Relevant files read: craft skill entrypoint, interface taxonomy, visual systems, motion and interaction, platform adapters, quality gates, and game UI eval evidence.
- Local reference written to `docs/design/codex-design-skill-reference.md`.

Design direction:
- Interface classification: game / interactive toy UI.
- Thesis: folded laboratory instrument / blueprint grid / nested spatial readout.
- Board remains the first-class surface; no marketing hero was added.
- No external visual assets were added because the game state itself is the inspectable artifact.

Components changed:
- `GameShell`
- `ControlPanel`
- `HelpOverlay`
- CSS design tokens, board styling, focus states, reduced-motion behavior, and responsive touch targets.

Actions taken:
- Added `docs/recursive-box-lab/DESIGN_BRIEF.md`.
- Added Google Fonts imports for `Space Grotesk` and `IBM Plex Mono`.
- Added global keyboard handling so WASD/arrow keys work without focusing the board.
- Added Help overlay with legend and control notes.
- Improved visual tokens, board framing, entity styling, focus-visible states, active/disabled/selected states, and short movement/fold animations.
- Ensured mobile controls meet 44px touch-target minimum.
- Redacted an old local absolute path from the ignored changelog after the design audit reported it.

Verification commands and results:
- `npm.cmd run test`: passed, 3 test files and 14 tests.
- `npm.cmd run typecheck`: passed.
- `npm.cmd run build`: passed; Vite built `dist/` successfully.
- Design audit script from codex-design-skill: passed with 0 errors and 0 warnings; only info noted no visual assets, which is intentional for this UI.
- Browser QA on `http://127.0.0.1:5173/`: app loaded, keyboard solved level 1 in two moves, Next Level enabled after solve, Help overlay opened/closed, Debug panel toggled, desktop had no horizontal overflow.
- Mobile viewport QA at 390x844: no horizontal overflow; all 19 buttons measured at least 44px by 44px after fixes.
- Vite dev server was stopped after QA and port 5173 was confirmed clear.

Screenshot:
- Desktop browser snapshot captured during QA for inspection; no screenshot artifact was saved or committed.

Known limitations:
- External font loading depends on Google Fonts availability; system fallbacks are defined.
- Inner preview depth is still capped for readability.
- Full help/about content and persistence remain Stage 5 tasks.

Next stage:
- Stage 5: expand levels to 15-20, add progress persistence, help/about documentation, architecture and level-design docs, static deployment instructions, and CI if appropriate.

## 2026-06-30 - Stage 3 Nested World Mechanics

Phase: stage 3 stronger recursive mechanics, expanded tutorial content, and debug tooling.

Time:
- 2026-06-30 09:53:16 +08:00

Rule changes:
- When a box with an `innerWorldId` moves into another world, its inner world's parent metadata now follows the box's new world location.
- This supports a finite box-contains-box relationship while preserving stable entity IDs.
- Existing pushInto and pushOut behavior remains pure-state and finite.
- Self-reference and obvious descendant containment are still rejected by the paradox guard.

UI changes:
- Added a Debug toggle in the control panel.
- Added `DebugPanel` with current world, entity count, recent action, and a layer tree.
- Kept nested world rendering compact and readable through recursive previews.

Level changes:
- Expanded tutorial content from 5 to 10 original levels.
- New levels:
  6. Nested Cargo
  7. Out to Receiver
  8. Chain Push
  9. Left Exit
  10. Deep Entry

Test coverage:
- Multi-layer pushInto.
- PushOut with stable entity identity.
- Box-contains-box parent update.
- Illegal self-reference containment rejection.
- Cross-world win condition detection.
- Ten-level schema validation and winning-path coverage.

Verification commands and results:
- `npm.cmd run test`: passed, 3 test files and 14 tests.
- `npm.cmd run typecheck`: passed.
- `npm.cmd run build`: passed; Vite built `dist/` successfully.

Changed files:
- `src/game/engine.ts`
- `src/game/recursiveMechanics.test.ts`
- `src/levels/tutorial.ts`
- `src/levels/tutorial.test.ts`
- `src/App.tsx`
- `src/ui/GameShell.tsx`
- `src/ui/controls/ControlPanel.tsx`
- `src/ui/debug/DebugPanel.tsx`
- `src/styles.css`
- Local-only `docs/logs/CHANGELOG.md`

Known limitations:
- The paradox guard rejects self-reference rather than modeling infinite recursion.
- DebugPanel is functional but visually plain until Stage 4 polish.
- Level progression is not persisted yet.

Next stage:
- Stage 4: read/reference the codex-design-skill source, write a design brief, refine tokens/components, improve responsive polish and motion, and manually check browser interaction.

## 2026-06-30 - Stage 2 Playable Prototype

Phase: stage 2 browser-playable MVP.

Time:
- 2026-06-30 09:49:16 +08:00

Actions taken:
- Added `lucide-react` for control icons.
- Replaced the placeholder shell with a playable React application.
- Added keyboard movement with WASD and arrow keys.
- Added UI controls for directional movement, Undo, Reset, and Next Level.
- Added current level display, move counter, solved status, level selection, and world breadcrumb.
- Added recursive world rendering with compact inner-world previews inside open boxes.
- Added five original tutorial levels:
  1. First Push
  2. Step Inside
  3. Load the Crate
  4. Push Out
  5. Two-Layer Transfer
- Added level tests that validate schema and confirm a winning path for every tutorial level.
- Updated README with local install, dev, test, typecheck, and build commands while preserving reset provenance.

Current recursive mechanism limitations:
- Inner-world previews are intentionally compact and show only two preview depths.
- Push-out maps an entity to the parent cell adjacent to the containing box in the movement direction.
- Self-reference remains rejected rather than simulated.
- Progress is not saved yet; that is deferred to Stage 5.

Known bugs:
- None found during Stage 2 verification.

Verification commands and results:
- `npm.cmd install lucide-react`: added 1 package.
- `npm.cmd run test`: passed, 2 test files and 9 tests.
- `npm.cmd run typecheck`: passed.
- `npm.cmd run build`: passed; Vite built `dist/` successfully.
- `npm.cmd run dev -- --port 5173`: started Vite at `http://127.0.0.1:5173/`.
- `Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing -Uri 'http://127.0.0.1:5173/'`: returned HTTP 200.
- Stopped the Vite node process that owned port 5173 and confirmed no listener remained on that port.

Changed files:
- `README.md`
- `package.json`
- `package-lock.json`
- `src/App.tsx`
- `src/styles.css`
- `src/levels/tutorial.ts`
- `src/levels/tutorial.test.ts`
- `src/ui/GameShell.tsx`
- `src/ui/controls/ControlPanel.tsx`
- `src/ui/controls/LevelSelect.tsx`
- `src/ui/world/Cell.tsx`
- `src/ui/world/EntitySprite.tsx`
- `src/ui/world/RecursiveWorldView.tsx`
- Local-only `docs/logs/CHANGELOG.md`

Next stage:
- Stage 3: add stronger nested-world mechanics, multi-layer navigation/rendering support, paradox-guard tests, five more levels for a total of ten, and a toggleable debug panel.

## 2026-06-30 - Stage 1 Core Model and Engine

Phase: stage 1 gameplay specification, data model, pure movement engine, and tests.

Time:
- 2026-06-30 09:43:30 +08:00

Actions taken:
- Added Vite, React, TypeScript, and Vitest project scaffolding.
- Added `docs/recursive-box-lab/SPEC.md` describing worlds, entities, coordinates, recursive rules, win conditions, and non-infringement boundaries.
- Implemented `src/game` modules:
  - `types.ts`
  - `levelSchema.ts`
  - `rules.ts`
  - `history.ts`
  - `engine.ts`
  - `index.ts`
- Added pure-state helpers for `applyMove`, `canMove`, `pushEntity`, `enterBox`, `exitBox`, `checkWin`, `undo`, and `reset`.
- Added Stage 1 tests for normal movement, pushing a box, wall collision, undo/reset, pushing a box into an open box, and pushing a box out from an inner world to a parent world.
- Added minimal React shell only to satisfy build verification; playable UI remains Stage 2.
- Updated `.gitignore` for dependencies, build output, coverage, Vite cache, env files, and npm debug logs.

Verification commands and results:
- `npm.cmd install`: added 103 packages and created `package-lock.json`.
- `npm.cmd run test`: passed, 1 test file and 6 tests.
- `npm.cmd run typecheck`: passed.
- `npm.cmd run build`: passed; Vite built `dist/` successfully.

Changed files:
- `.gitignore`
- `package.json`
- `package-lock.json`
- `tsconfig.json`
- `vite.config.ts`
- `index.html`
- `docs/recursive-box-lab/SPEC.md`
- `src/main.tsx`
- `src/App.tsx`
- `src/styles.css`
- `src/game/types.ts`
- `src/game/levelSchema.ts`
- `src/game/rules.ts`
- `src/game/history.ts`
- `src/game/engine.ts`
- `src/game/index.ts`
- `src/game/engine.test.ts`
- Local-only `docs/logs/CHANGELOG.md`

Risks and limitations:
- Stage 1 implements finite parent-child recursion only.
- Self-reference is rejected rather than simulated.
- The browser UI is still a placeholder until Stage 2.

Next stage:
- Stage 2: create playable UI, keyboard controls, undo/reset/next buttons, world breadcrumb, nested world previews, five original tutorial levels, and README run instructions.

## 2026-06-30 - Stage 0 Audit for Recursive Box Lab

Phase: stage 0 project audit and preservation.

Audit time:
- 2026-06-30 09:36:23 +08:00

Branch and remote:
- Started on `main`, tracking `origin/main`.
- Created implementation branch `feature/recursive-box-lab`.
- Remote: `https://github.com/Udkam/Game-1.git`.

Existing documents found and reviewed:
- `README.md`
- `docs/reboot/CURRENT_STATUS.md`
- `docs/reboot/FAILED_ROUND.md`
- Local-only `docs/logs/CHANGELOG.md`

Adopted and preserved:
- The repository is a documentation-only reset after a failed v8 round.
- The failed branch must not be used as a continuation base.
- Backup branch and tag mentioned by the reboot records remain provenance only.
- `docs/logs/CHANGELOG.md` remains local-only and ignored by `.gitignore`.

Discarded as a continuation base:
- Any implementation, level design, visual language, or page structure from the failed v8 reboot branch.

Actions taken:
- Verified git branch, status, and remote.
- Listed tracked and hidden project files.
- Read all retained docs with explicit UTF-8 handling after an initial mojibake console read of the objective file.
- Created `docs/recursive-box-lab/PLAN.md` for the fresh implementation plan.

Verification commands and results:
- `git status --short --branch`: clean on `main` before branch creation.
- `git remote -v`: confirmed `origin` fetch/push URL.
- `git branch --show-current`: confirmed `main`, then created `feature/recursive-box-lab`.
- `rg --files --hidden -g '!.git' -g '!node_modules' -g '!dist' -g '!build' -g '!coverage'`: confirmed only reset docs plus `.gitignore` and local ignored changelog.
- No `package.json` existed, so no npm install/test/build commands were available for Stage 0.

Changed files:
- Added `docs/recursive-box-lab/PLAN.md`.
- Updated local-only `docs/logs/CHANGELOG.md`.

Risks:
- The project starts from no runnable implementation.
- The reboot docs mention `codex.md` from an older convention, but current local workflow keeps this log at `docs/logs/CHANGELOG.md`.

Next stage:
- Stage 1: create the TypeScript/Vite/Vitest project skeleton, write `docs/recursive-box-lab/SPEC.md`, implement the pure core engine in `src/game`, and add unit tests for movement, pushing, undo/reset, pushInto, and pushOut.

## 2026-06-25 - Reset After Failed v8 Reboot

Phase: failure declaration and repository cleanup.

User decision:
- The current v8 implementation is failed.
- Stop repairing or polishing the existing implementation.
- Delete local implementation files.
- Delete the remote reboot branch.
- Keep only necessary explanatory and record documents.
- Push the resulting reset state to `main`.

Actions taken:
- Read the specified goal objective file before continuing.
- Confirmed current branch and remote state.
- Confirmed the failed reboot branch was at pushed commit `50b3d62`.
- Confirmed `origin/main` was at `9a22d58` before reset.
- Confirmed no local dev server session was still available and no listener was found on port `5173`.
- Switched to `main` and pulled `origin/main` with `--ff-only`.
- Verified the repository root path before deletion; local absolute path redacted from this handoff log.
- Removed all repository contents except `.git`.
- Recreated only the reset notice, failure record, and this local handoff log.

Files intentionally kept or recreated:
- `README.md`
- `codex.md`
- `docs/reboot/FAILED_ROUND.md`
- `docs/reboot/CURRENT_STATUS.md`

Files intentionally removed from `main`:
- Application source and UI implementation.
- Server implementation.
- Build output and dependency folders.
- Previous generated reboot implementation docs and screenshots.
- Uncommitted v8 review-package drafts.

Verification commands and results:
- `git status --short --branch`: confirmed current failed branch and uncommitted v8 drafts before reset.
- `git remote -v`: confirmed `origin` is `https://github.com/Udkam/Game-1.git`.
- `git ls-remote --heads origin ...`: confirmed main, backup branch, and failed reboot branch existed before cleanup.
- `git switch -f main; git pull --ff-only origin main`: switched to `main`; result was already up to date.
- Path guard before deletion succeeded; wipe command refused to run unless cwd matched the expected `Game-1` absolute path.
- `git push origin main`: pushed reset commit `d9aaa86` to `origin/main`.
- `git push origin --delete reboot/parabox-worldline-v8-reboot-parabox-worldline-20260624-023038-2a151f`: deleted the failed remote reboot branch.
- `git branch -D reboot/parabox-worldline-v8-reboot-parabox-worldline-20260624-023038-2a151f`: deleted the failed local reboot branch.
- `rg --files`: confirmed the local working tree only contains `README.md`, `codex.md`, `docs/reboot/FAILED_ROUND.md`, and `docs/reboot/CURRENT_STATUS.md`.
- `git ls-remote --heads origin ...`: confirmed `origin/main` and the backup branch remain, and the failed reboot branch is absent.
- `git ls-remote --tags origin backup-pre-reboot-v8-reboot-parabox-worldline-20260624-023038-2a151f`: confirmed the backup tag remains on the remote.

Risks:
- The failed implementation is no longer present on `main`.
- The deleted reboot branch should not be used as a continuation point.
- Backup branch and tag are retained intentionally for provenance unless the user explicitly requests deleting them too.

Next steps:
- Start any future implementation from the documentation-only `main` baseline.
- Create a fresh run id and branch for the next reboot.
- Do not continue from the failed v8 reboot branch.
