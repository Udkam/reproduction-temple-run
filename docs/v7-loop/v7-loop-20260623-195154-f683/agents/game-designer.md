# Agent Log: game-designer

Agent: game-designer
Task clarity: clear
Capability fit: good
Questions needed: none
Assumptions: mechanics should be deterministic, replayable, and fair before being visually flashy.
Proceed decision: proceed

## Responsibility

Own v7 mechanism rules and puzzle identity.

## Decisions made

- Use quantum lab language for portals, echoes, sync actors, swaps, recursion, chain state, and misdirection.
- Retain pull only if reframed as a tractor tether and fully replayed.
- Stage 5 vertical slice uses energy cores, quantum portals, synchronized drone chambers, mirrored sync, delayed time shadows, quantum plates, and fair visible misdirection.
- Stage 5 avoided claiming spatial swap, recursion, or chain-state completion because those are not playable yet.
- Stage 6 adds authored scenario coverage for spatial swap, recursive room, chain-state, misdirection, and final multi-mechanic bosses while marking advanced items `manual-reviewed` or replay-based instead of solver-optimal.
- Stage 6 keeps all misdirection notes explicit with `trick` and `fairness` fields.

## Files touched

- `src/engine/v7Levels.ts`
- `src/web/ui.ts`
- `docs/v7-loop/v7-loop-20260623-195154-f683/06-level-design-matrix.md`
- Stage docs and `codex.md`

## Risks

- Too many mechanisms can become shallow. The 15-level slice must prove depth before full expansion.
- The first two sync levels are intentionally tutorial-simple; later chapter levels must add non-trivial interference and asymmetric constraints.
- Stage 6 reaches the full requested content map, but deeper mechanism identity for spatial swap, recursion, and chain-state still depends on the next review loop rather than this stage alone.

## Review notes

- Every misdirection level needs fairness evidence.
- Stage 5 notes include `trick` and `fairness` for all 15 slice levels.
- Stage 6 notes include `trick` and `fairness` for all 70 levels.
- Stage 6 final six levels are multi-mechanic scenarios in the catalog and verify through replay/manual validation.

## Next handoff

- QA should treat visual smoke as a design review too: any level that looks like a corridor-only helper variation must be sent back for rewrite even if replay verification passes.

## Stage 9 Redesign Reset

Agent: game-designer
Task clarity: clear
Capability fit: good
Questions needed: none
Assumptions: Reference-study principles are design input, not material to copy.
Proceed decision: proceed

Decisions made:

- Mechanism work restarts around six systems: recursive space, worldline split, time echo, spatial swap, multi-drone sync, and rule-block parameters.
- New levels must start from a core question and aha moment, not from a prop checklist.
- The existing 70-level catalog is product-rejected and should not be expanded.

Files touched:

- `docs/v7-loop/v7-loop-20260623-195154-f683/11-reference-study.md`
- `docs/v7-loop/v7-loop-20260623-195154-f683/12-redesign-spec.md`
- `docs/v7-loop/v7-loop-20260623-195154-f683/13-puzzle-grammar.md`
- `docs/v7-loop/v7-loop-20260623-195154-f683/15-vertical-slice-20-report.md`

Risks:

- Six systems can still become shallow if the slice tries to teach too much per level.

Review notes:

- Every accepted level needs a fairness proof, false path, and "why not boring" note.

Next handoff:

- Level designer should implement only the 20 planned seeds after the engine can express the relevant systems.
## Stage 10 Update

Agent: game-designer

Task clarity: clear
Capability fit: good
Questions needed: none
Assumptions: The 20-level slice is a grammar proof, not the full requested campaign.
Proceed decision: proceed

decisions made:
- Kept the slice centered on recursive space, worldline split, time echo, spatial swap, sync actors, rule blocks, portals, and fair misdirection.
- Preserved metadata fields for core idea, trick, fairness, difficulty, solver status, par, and solution.

files touched:
- `src/engine/v7Levels.ts`
- `docs/v7-loop/v7-loop-20260623-195154-f683/06-level-design-matrix.md`
- `docs/v7-loop/v7-loop-20260623-195154-f683/13-puzzle-grammar.md`

risks:
- Several levels are compact proofs rather than deep boss puzzles.
- Recursive and rule-block systems are lightweight in this slice.

review notes:
- Stage 10 is directionally better but should be deepened before expanding to 70.

next handoff:
- Level design should add solver-backed variants and deeper non-trivial branches in the next loop.
