# Agent Log: solver-engineer

Agent: solver-engineer
Task clarity: partial
Capability fit: good
Questions needed: none
Assumptions: full optimal solving for every v7 mechanism is not required if replay verification and manual review are explicit.
Proceed decision: proceed

## Responsibility

Own solver, replay verification, audit scripts, and validation reporting.

## Decisions made

- Use `optimal`, `verified-replay`, and `manual-reviewed` as required statuses.
- Extend `verify` to print id, title, chapter, status, solution length, par, method, pass/fail.
- Add `audit:levels`, `audit:ui`, `audit:content`, and `smoke:visual`.
- Stage 4 upgraded `verify` output to the v7 field set while keeping current solver/replay behavior.
- Stage 4 distinguishes inferred `optimal`, `verified-replay`, `manual-replay`, `joint-state-replay`, and `history-window-replay` paths.
- Stage 5 fixed `verify` so declared `optimal` levels must run the solver even when a stored replay exists.
- Stage 5 fixed `smoke-api` to use the current first level id instead of old `l1`.
- Stage 6 implemented `audit:levels`, `audit:ui`, and `audit:content`.
- Stage 7 implemented `smoke:visual` with Playwright screenshots.

## Files touched

- `scripts/verify-levels.ts`
- `scripts/smoke-api.ts`
- `scripts/audit-levels.ts`
- `scripts/audit-ui.ts`
- `scripts/audit-content.ts`
- `src/engine/types.ts`
- Stage docs and `codex.md`

## Risks

- Current verify output claims optimality even when stored solutions are merely replayed.
- Until v7 `levelDesignNote` is filled for all 70 levels, some verification statuses are inferred from legacy data.
- Stage 5 only validates 15 current levels; final `audit:levels` must enforce exactly 70.
- Stage 6 closes the 70-level audit gate, but all current final levels are replay/manual verified rather than solved by mechanism-specific optimal solvers.
- Replay/manual reliance remains high; deeper solvers for spatial swap, chain-state, and recursive-room behavior are still pending.

## Review notes

- Verification wording must distinguish solver optimal from replay-only.
- Stage 4 verification passed and now prints `id/title/chapter/solverStatus/solutionLength/par/validation/pass`.
- Stage 5 verification passed for the 15-level v7 slice, including solver-backed optimal rows with nonzero explored states.
- Stage 6 verification passed for all 70 levels and server API accepted all stored solutions.
- Stage 6 `audit:levels` initially failed duplicate exact signatures; after board/route variation it passed with one retained warning about replay/manual reliance.
- Stage 6 `audit:ui` and `audit:content` passed after adding explicit transition/mobile/content checks.
- Stage 7 `smoke:visual` passed and generated all required screenshots.

## Next handoff

- Build deeper mechanism-specific validation for spatial swap, recursive-room, and chain-state chapters; keep replay/manual warning visible until then.

## Stage 9 Redesign Reset

Agent: solver-engineer
Task clarity: clear
Capability fit: good
Questions needed: none
Assumptions: The next accepted checkpoint is 20 redesign levels, not the rejected 70-level catalog.
Proceed decision: proceed

Decisions made:

- `audit:content` should check the new redesign documents and explicit rejection/reset language.
- Future `audit:levels` must support a slice gate that expects exactly 20 accepted redesign levels until 70-level expansion is re-approved.
- Replay verification remains mandatory for every accepted level.

Files touched:

- `scripts/audit-content.ts`
- `docs/v7-loop/v7-loop-20260623-195154-f683/15-vertical-slice-20-report.md`

Risks:

- Current `audit:levels` still validates the rejected 70-level checkpoint; it must be changed during implementation.

Review notes:

- This stage can pass content/typecheck checks but cannot claim runtime redesign acceptance.

Next handoff:

- Add slice-mode level audit and visual smoke assertions when the new runtime catalog is implemented.
## Stage 10 Update

Agent: solver-engineer

Task clarity: clear
Capability fit: good
Questions needed: none
Assumptions: Replay verification is acceptable for this slice but must be reported as a limitation.
Proceed decision: proceed

decisions made:
- Retained stored replay validation for every slice level.
- Updated level audit to warn, not fail, when all slice levels are replay/manual.
- Required spatial-swap behavior probing in `audit:levels`.

files touched:
- `scripts/verify-levels.ts`
- `scripts/audit-levels.ts`
- `scripts/smoke-api.ts`
- `scripts/smoke-ui.ts`

risks:
- Solver optimality is not proven for the new slice.

review notes:
- `npm run verify` passed for 20/20; `audit:levels` passed with the replay/manual warning.

next handoff:
- Add targeted solver modes for classic/sync/time/spatial-swap levels in the next gameplay-depth loop.
