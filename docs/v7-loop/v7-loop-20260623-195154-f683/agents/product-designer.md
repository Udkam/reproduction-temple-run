# Agent Log: product-designer

Agent: product-designer
Task clarity: clear
Capability fit: good
Questions needed: none
Assumptions: v7 replaces the current user-facing product, not only the board renderer.
Proceed decision: proceed

## Responsibility

Own product flow, screens, navigation, progress surfaces, and acceptance framing.

## Decisions made

- Home must become a command deck, not a title plus level list.
- Chapter selection uses a star map / node graph.
- Completion, challenge records, settings, and mechanism archive are required screens.
- Stage 2 copy now states v6 is retired rather than current success.
- Stage 3 command deck includes primary continue, chapter star map, mechanism archive, challenge records, settings, progress, recent level, and completion rate.
- Stage 3 keeps the level list available under the star-map section so the current product stays playable during the rebuild.

## Files touched

- `README.md`
- `claude.md`
- `src/web/ui.ts`
- `src/web/styles.css`
- `package.json`
- Stage docs and `codex.md`

## Risks

- UI may remain too close to v6 if only colors change.
- Stage 3 changes the shell strongly, but the level corpus and mechanics are still old and can still make the product feel transitional.

## Review notes

- QA must compare final screenshots against current v6 to confirm the product visibly changed.
- Stage 3 passes navigation shell checks, but final acceptance requires 70 v7 levels, mechanism archive depth, visual screenshots, mobile checks, and content audits.

## Next handoff

- Frontend and art agents use this flow as the screen contract.

## Stage 9 Redesign Reset

Agent: product-designer
Task clarity: clear
Capability fit: good
Questions needed: none
Assumptions: The user's screenshot QA supersedes prior Stage 8 technical pass status.
Proceed decision: proceed

Decisions made:

- Current v7 product structure is rejected and must not be patched as-is.
- New information architecture is `Driftbox: Worldline Lab`: experiment console, worldline graph, chamber panel, research notes, experiment data, and calibration.
- Accepted next target is a 20-level vertical slice before any renewed 70-level expansion.

Files touched:

- `README.md`
- `claude.md`
- `docs/v7-loop/v7-loop-20260623-195154-f683/12-redesign-spec.md`
- `docs/v7-loop/v7-loop-20260623-195154-f683/14-ui-redesign-spec.md`
- `docs/v7-loop/v7-loop-20260623-195154-f683/15-vertical-slice-20-report.md`

Risks:

- Runtime still exposes the rejected 70-level checkpoint until implementation replaces it.

Review notes:

- QA must reject any next home screen that still reads as title/progress/buttons/cards.

Next handoff:

- Frontend and art agents should build the console/worldline/chamber structure from the new UI spec, not mutate the old card shell.
## Stage 10 Update

Agent: product-designer

Task clarity: clear
Capability fit: good
Questions needed: none
Assumptions: Stage 10 is a 20-level proof slice and must not be marketed as final 70-level completion.
Proceed decision: proceed

decisions made:
- Accepted the runtime direction shift to `Worldline Lab`: quantum experiment console, worldline map, chamber panel, and drone state sheet.
- Required top-level docs to state "20-level slice, not final 70-level product."

files touched:
- `README.md`
- `claude.md`
- `docs/v7-loop/v7-loop-20260623-195154-f683/10-acceptance-report.md`
- `docs/v7-loop/v7-loop-20260623-195154-f683/15-vertical-slice-20-report.md`

risks:
- Final 70-level scope remains incomplete.
- The slice still needs human product review beyond automated screenshots.

review notes:
- Reject any future claim that Stage 10 equals final v7 completion.

next handoff:
- QA should judge whether the new screenshots truly break away from the rejected card-grid route before 70-level expansion resumes.
