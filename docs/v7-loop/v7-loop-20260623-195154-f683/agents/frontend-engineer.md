# Agent Log: frontend-engineer

Agent: frontend-engineer
Task clarity: clear
Capability fit: good
Questions needed: none
Assumptions: keep the plain TypeScript DOM stack unless the existing app becomes harder to maintain than replacing it.
Proceed decision: proceed

## Responsibility

Own UI shell, routes, board rendering, transitions, responsive layout, and visual smoke hooks.

## Decisions made

- Retire user-facing `IsoRenderer` path.
- Keep server and engine APIs as the source of truth for level/replay data.
- Add DOM landmarks/classes for `audit:ui`.
- Stage 2 removed the visible dev demo entry and runtime 3D catalog exposure.
- Stage 3 rebuilt the home screen as a command deck and added DOM-visible routes for chapter map, codex, records, and settings.
- Stage 3 replaced the old CSS surface with a new 2D sci-fi shell while keeping the existing `App` wiring stable.
- Stage 4 added a visible `time-shadow` board piece and preserved the existing board renderer for old levels.
- Stage 4 exposes `lastBlockedReason` through game wrappers for later HUD/feedback rendering.
- Stage 5 rewrote mechanism codex entries and anchors to the v7 slice.
- Stage 5 runtime catalog now exposes 15 v7 levels, and UI smoke plays all of them to win.
- Stage 5 removed the remaining level-page `IsoRenderer` / demo fallback path from `ui.ts`.
- Stage 5 moved local progress to `driftbox.progress.v7` and made time-shadow plate pressure visible in the renderer.
- Stage 6 added testable screen transition classes and a requestAnimationFrame fallback for jsdom.
- Stage 6 added CSS transition rules and mobile horizontal overflow guards.
- Stage 6 UI audit now checks command deck, chapter star map, mechanism archive, records, settings, HUD, 2D board, win overlay, transition class, mobile guard, and absence of legacy camera UI.
- Stage 7 added Playwright visual smoke coverage for home, chapter map, mechanism archive, representative mechanics, win overlay, mobile home, and mobile level views.
- Stage 7 fixed the mobile intro banner after screenshot QA showed the dismiss button wrapping vertically.
- Stage 8 added level-page mechanism chips and blocked-move HUD feedback.

## Files touched

- `src/web/ui.ts`
- `src/engine/levels.ts`
- `README.md`
- `claude.md`
- `package.json`
- `src/web/styles.css`
- `src/web/game.ts`
- `src/web/render.ts`
- `src/web/ui.ts`
- `src/web/progress.ts`
- Stage docs and `codex.md`

## Risks

- Current `src/web/ui.ts` is too large and mixes routing, input, rendering, modals, and camera behavior.
- Stage 3 has DOM verification but not full Playwright screenshots yet.
- The new settings and records overlays are product shells; they need deeper persistence/settings behavior in later stages.
- Blocked-reason data is not yet surfaced in HUD copy or animation.
- Old 3D demo source remains in the repo as unreachable history; final content audit should decide whether to delete or archive it outside runtime source.
- Playwright screenshots now exist, but visual smoke is still a rendering gate rather than full UX/design critique.

## Review notes

- Split by screen/component enough to keep v7 maintainable.
- Stage 2 leaves old 2.5D code unused as history. Later stages should remove or archive it when the v7 shell replaces the legacy UI.
- Stage 3 verification passed: `typecheck`, `verify`, `smoke:api`, `smoke:ui`, `build`, and a temporary DOM audit for new home/navigation landmarks.
- Stage 4 verification passed after renderer support for the time-shadow piece.
- Stage 5 UI smoke passed for all 15 v7 levels.
- Stage 6 UI smoke passed for all 70 levels through jsdom.
- Stage 6 `audit:ui` passed after explicit overlay, transition, and mobile guard checks were added.
- Stage 7 `smoke:visual` passed and wrote 15 screenshots under `docs/v7-loop/v7-loop-20260623-195154-f683/screenshots/`.
- Stage 7 screenshot QA failure: `15-mobile-level.png` initially collapsed `知道了` into vertical text; CSS now stacks intro content on mobile and keeps the button on one line.
- Stage 8 `audit:ui` passed with assertions for advanced mechanism archive entries, mechanism chips, and blocked-feedback text.

## Next handoff

- Continue with richer chain-state indicators and more concrete swap/recursive affordances once rule-depth work lands.

## Stage 9 Redesign Reset

Agent: frontend-engineer
Task clarity: clear
Capability fit: good
Questions needed: none
Assumptions: Existing DOM/CSS can be used as scaffolding, but current home/map/chamber composition is rejected.
Proceed decision: proceed

Decisions made:

- Next implementation must replace the home with a quantum experiment console.
- Chapter selection must become an SVG/DOM worldline graph with edges and boss nodes.
- Chamber view must become an experiment panel with mechanism instruments, not a board card.
- Visual smoke must replace the old 15-screenshot set with the redesign-specific 13-screenshot set including the character state sheet.

Files touched:

- `docs/v7-loop/v7-loop-20260623-195154-f683/14-ui-redesign-spec.md`
- `README.md`
- `claude.md`

Risks:

- Incremental CSS patches are likely to preserve the rejected layout skeleton.

Review notes:

- UI audit must be updated in the implementation stage to fail on card-grid chapter maps.

Next handoff:

- Start from new screen composition and component boundaries before wiring level data.
## Stage 10 Update

Agent: frontend-engineer

Task clarity: clear
Capability fit: good
Questions needed: none
Assumptions: The app remains plain DOM + Vite; no framework migration.
Proceed decision: proceed

decisions made:
- Reworked navigation tests around `.worldline-node` instead of `.level-card`.
- Added CSS for quantum console, worldline graph, chamber screen, branch lanes, character state sheet, and victory collapse.
- Kept mobile d-pad and board scaling active.

files touched:
- `src/web/ui.ts`
- `src/web/styles.css`
- `scripts/audit-ui.ts`
- `scripts/smoke-ui.ts`
- `scripts/smoke-visual.ts`

risks:
- Visual layout is screenshot-tested but not yet tested across many intermediate viewport widths.

review notes:
- `audit:ui`, `smoke:ui`, `smoke:visual`, and `build` passed after the redesign CSS and selector updates.

next handoff:
- Add viewport matrix checks before broad public release.
