# Agent Log: level-designer

Agent: level-designer
Task clarity: clear
Capability fit: good
Questions needed: none
Assumptions: generated filler is not acceptable for v7 unless individually reviewed and documented.
Proceed decision: proceed

## Responsibility

Own 70-level matrix, level notes, difficulty progression, and quality criteria.

## Decisions made

- Use the requested 9-chapter `8*8 + 6` structure.
- No level counts without `levelDesignNote`.
- Full 70-level buildout starts only after 15-level vertical slice passes.
- Stage 5 created a 15-level v7 vertical slice with documented `levelDesignNote` records.
- Stage 5 slice coverage: startup/core push (5), quantum portals (3), synchronized actors (3), time-shadow gates (4).
- Stage 6 expanded the live catalog to exactly 70 levels with the requested 8+8+8+8+8+8+8+8+6 chapter counts.
- Stage 6 allowed helper-generated board families only after per-level metadata review and duplicate-signature auditing.
- Stage 6 kept advanced chapter entries as replay/manual-reviewed candidates instead of claiming full solver optimality.

## Files touched

- `src/engine/v7Levels.ts`
- `src/engine/levels.ts`
- `docs/v7-loop/v7-loop-20260623-195154-f683/06-level-design-matrix.md`
- Stage docs and `codex.md`

## Risks

- Reusing old generated layout patterns would fail the quality bar.
- The slice is 15/70 and does not include spatial swap, recursion, or chain-state playable levels yet.
- Early sync levels are deliberately simple; full buildout needs deeper joint-state puzzles.
- Stage 6 solved the count and metadata gates, but spatial swap, recursive room, and chain-state chapters still need deeper rule-depth review after visual smoke.

## Review notes

- `audit:levels` must catch exact duplicates, canonical mirror duplicates, missing notes, and weak water levels.
- Stage 5 matrix lists all 15 slice levels with chapter, mechanics, space profile, difficulty, solver status, par, and validation method.
- Stage 6 `audit:levels` passed for exactly 70 levels, chapter counts, metadata, required mechanics, exact duplicate signatures, and obvious short-level scan.
- Stage 6 initial duplicate audit failures were fixed by varying the affected portal/sync/chain board signatures and rerunning `audit:levels`, `verify`, and `smoke:ui`.
- Stage 7 screenshot coverage includes representative portal, sync, time-shadow, spatial-swap, recursive, chain, misdirection, and finale views.
- Stage 7 negative review: screenshots and replay validation do not remove the need for sample-play quality review of advanced chapters 5-7.

## Next handoff

- QA must sample-play advanced chapters and record any level that still feels like a metadata-only variation rather than a distinct puzzle.

## Stage 9 Redesign Reset

Agent: level-designer
Task clarity: clear
Capability fit: good
Questions needed: none
Assumptions: The current 70-level catalog is rejected even if it passes `verify`.
Proceed decision: proceed

Decisions made:

- Stop expanding or polishing the current 70-level catalog.
- Restart accepted level work with a 20-level slice: 4 startup, 3 quantum link, 3 sync, 3 time echo, 3 spatial swap, 2 recursive, and 2 misdirection levels.
- Every new level seed must include core question, aha moment, inference, false path, fairness proof, minimum solution outline, and why it is not boring.

Files touched:

- `docs/v7-loop/v7-loop-20260623-195154-f683/13-puzzle-grammar.md`
- `docs/v7-loop/v7-loop-20260623-195154-f683/15-vertical-slice-20-report.md`

Risks:

- The 20-level slice can still fail if it only covers mechanics shallowly.

Review notes:

- The planned slice is not accepted content yet because no runtime replay has been implemented.

Next handoff:

- Engine and frontend should implement enough system support before finalizing level data.
## Stage 10 Update

Agent: level-designer

Task clarity: clear
Capability fit: good
Questions needed: none
Assumptions: The active gate is exactly 20 redesign slice levels.
Proceed decision: proceed

decisions made:
- Accepted the 4/3/3/3/3/2/2 chapter distribution for the slice.
- Required all slice levels to carry design metadata and stored replay solutions.
- Required `audit:levels` to reject missing metadata, one-step water levels, missing active swap, missing recursive entry core, and worldline levels without twin state.

files touched:
- `src/engine/v7Levels.ts`
- `scripts/audit-levels.ts`
- `docs/v7-loop/v7-loop-20260623-195154-f683/06-level-design-matrix.md`

risks:
- All slice levels rely on replay/manual status.
- Full 70-level variety is not yet delivered.

review notes:
- The current level corpus is acceptable as a slice gate only.

next handoff:
- Before 70-level expansion, create chapter-by-chapter quality gates for depth, non-isomorphism, and manual sample-play notes.
