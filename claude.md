# Driftbox Work Report

RUN_ID: `v7-loop-20260623-195154-f683`

## Current Direction

Driftbox is now in a `v7-rebuild-redesign` loop.

The previous v6 2.5D route is considered failed for product acceptance and is no longer the user-facing mainline.

The first v7 70-level implementation checkpoint is also rejected as a product direction. It passed technical gates, but screenshot review found that it still behaves like old Driftbox with a sci-fi skin:

- homepage structure remains too close to title/progress/buttons/cards;
- chapter selection remains too close to card-grid navigation;
- chamber UI remains too close to old square Sokoban tiles;
- role design still inherits small-person/Pip language;
- levels do not yet prove recursive/worldline/system-puzzle depth.

## Active Target

The accepted next target was a new 20-level vertical slice before any renewed 70-level expansion. That slice is now the active runtime.

The redesign direction is `Driftbox: Worldline Lab`:

- quantum experiment console home;
- worldline/star graph chapter map;
- integrated chamber experiment panel;
- non-human quantum drone state component and state sheet;
- recursive space, worldline split, time echo, spatial swap, multi-drone sync, and rule-block parameters;
- stored solution replay for all 20 accepted slice levels;
- screenshot QA that proves the product no longer resembles the rejected v7 route.

This is not the final 70-level product. The next loop must either deepen the 20-level slice after visual review or expand from this grammar toward 70 levels with fresh level-quality gates.

## v6 Archival Note

The v6 2.5D work remains available through git history only as historical context. It must not be described as the current finished direction, and its public runtime entries are retired during the v7 loop.
